## Lab 1 {background-image="frmt/normal-background-1.png"}

#### Lab topics:

R review

#### R Advantages:

-   **Open-Source**.
-   An Active Community.
-   Support for **statistical programming** is excellent.
-   Easy data wrangling.

## Lab 1 {background-image="frmt/normal-background-1.png"}

#### Before Starting:

- Ensure **R** is working properly on your computer.
- I recommend  **RStudio**, an IDE with several advantages:
    - Simple process for writing **R** code
    - Ability to inspect variables
    - Visualization of generated plots
    - Additional useful features

#### Hints and advises:

-   The required functions can be found in the pre-reading material.
    
    When you need to view the required arguments for a function, you can do so by typing `?function`.
-   How to access a dataset's variable? 
    
    `dataset$variable`
    
    

## Lab 2 {background-image="frmt/normal-background-1.png"}

#### Lab topic:

Probability and Random Variables

#### Hints and Tips:
::: {style='font-size:1em'}
- $P(\text{at least x times something happens})$ can be broken down into all possible scenarios.
- Q2: The reliability of the chain is the probability that the chain works.
  
    It's recommended to start by dividing the chain into two sections.
